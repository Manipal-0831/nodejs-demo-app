Project : CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a web app.
This project will help you build, test, Dockerize, and deploy a simple Node.js app using GitHub Actions and Docker Hub. No experience required—just follow each step!
A simple *Node.js demo application* to demonstrate *CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions and Docker Hub.  
Whenever you push code to GitHub, the app automatically builds a new Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

What You Will Learn
How to install Node.js, npm, Docker, Git, and GitHub Desktop
How to set up folders and files for a Node.js web app
How to build and run your app locally and in Docker
How to automate everything using a professional CI/CD pipeline

Tools Needed
Node.js & npm: Download from https://nodejs.org
Git: Download from https://git-scm.com
Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
A GitHub account: https://github.com
A Docker Hub account: https://hub.docker.com 

Step-by-Step Setup
1. Install Required Tools
Download and install Node.js (includes npm)
Download and install Git
Download and install Docker Desktop and sign in with your Docker Hub account
Create accounts at GitHub and Docker Hub (if you don’t have them)

Create Project Folder and Files
Open Git and run the below commands
First Clone This Repository by running the "git clone https://github.com/Manipal-0831/nodejs-demo-app.git"
then run below commands
cd nodejs-demo-app
npm init -y (use if not cloned )
npm install express
npm start 

Create Secrects
First go to docker hub and create personal access token with read,write,delete permissions 
Set GitHub Secrets
Go to
Your Repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
Add two secrets:
DOCKER_USERNAME (your Docker Hub username)
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (Docker Hub access personal access token)

Trigger the GitHub workflow
now you see the result in on GitHub Actions 
Green tick indicates successful 
Red tick indicates error
After Green tick 
build the latest image from docker hub to local and run a container for local testing 
for that run the below commands
Build your Docker image (replace yourdockerhubusername):
docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/nodejs-demo-app:latest .
Run the container:
docker run -p 3000:3000 yourdockerhubusername/nodejs-demo-app:latest .

Check Conatiner running or not
docker ps
then visit localhost:3000
now a web page gives reponse Node.js CI/CD Demo running successfully!

Note:
Initialize and connect git:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/nodejs-demo-app.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

Cleaning the set up for docker container
Stop the container 
run docker ps ( then cpoy container id )
run docker stop container id 
run docker rm container id ( deletes the container)
